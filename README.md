this is version 1.1.0

needed currently:

a bag that can be used to switch items between screens ###### NEEDS WORKED ON

bag currently has adding items. needs to render items correctly and also load items correctly (easy fix i hope) bag needs internal physics :D

make it so that the handle burns off if it's made of wood (maybe? maybe just set it as it as a low max heat and then I can make every part of the sword dynamically heat)

day/night cycle

weather cycle

moving the ship to other waters

functionality for the charms as in they actually do something and aren't fancy paperweights
