this is version 1.1.0

needed currently:



hanging physics for charms

make charms be nailed to the charmboard when hovered and released on the charmboard

allow charms to also be nailed to other charms. dont show nail though. :D

right clicking nailed charms releases them.

a bag that can be used to switch items between screens

maybe a day/night now? unsure.

after these start working on gameplay loop!
