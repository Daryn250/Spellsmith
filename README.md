this is version 1.0.1

needed currently:

add rotational velocity to item velocity when released

"shadow" effect on the ground for items, make it be where the item will fall

item flags for switching to different screens, aka making them into buttons

maybe test saving and loading again a few times, mainly because loading items didn't load all the items in the save file

utility for switching items between screens => get item uuid, save item to different screen and delete it from current

update save and load to save the screen that items were saved on
