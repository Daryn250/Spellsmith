this is version 1.1.0

needed currently:

make it so that the handle burns off if it's made of wood (maybe? maybe just set it as it as a low max heat and then I can make every part of the sword dynamically heat)

day/night cycle

weather cycle

moving the ship to other waters

rewrite of the charms probably. sucks but it's needed. plus with new functionalities should be easier.




# story
you were young and left on a boat, in a world with many oceans and water. you make swords for the two (?) factions, 
the regal knights, a band of knights seperated by hierarchy. you also make swords for the dungeon keepers, people 
or monsters who run dungeons and their ecosystems. helping out either side boosts your reputation with them and 
lowers your reputation with the other side.
if a dungeon gets too powerful, the regal knights will swoop in and defeat it, leaving it to ruin. if a dungeon 
is too weak, people will get cocky and children and teens will venture in, to never return.
in a dungeon, they need strong weapons to scare off the people who will most likely die, but not so many that 
the dungeon becomes too powerful.
you take more clients as your smithing gets better, and the story can end in 3 ways:
you help the regal knights kill every dungeon leader, and then the knights are disbanded for no need of them
you help the dungeon keepers become too powerful for the regal knights, and they are all killed and the dungeons 
break the surface and take over the world
you find an equillibrium maybe and both sides come to an agreement to prevent dungeons from becoming too powerful 
or from knights becoming too powerful.

Enchantments: # "modifiers" that bring up one stat. one per part.


Curses: # high-tier modifiers that can bring up multiple stats at the cost of others. one per part.


Effects: # glyph driven blade modification soup. for the nerds.
Protocol:
first, have a combination of letters and numbers that represent glyph fragments. next, make it like code. finally, run the code and determine the output spell.
ex:
the string "a1e" could translate into 'a' for fire, '1' for ranged, and 'e' for a focus on speed.
