this is version 1.1.0

needed currently:

a bag that can be used to switch items between screens

day/night cycle

weather cycle

moving the ship to other waters

functionality for the charms as in they actually do something and aren't fancy paperweights

What I'm actually working on:

I'm making it so you can kickflip your tools. Currently needs animations for the tricks, and the logic for selecting tricks. i have the quick window, also needs to be cleared on any interaction with mouse. also kind of want it only to be visible when right mouse is down.
