this is version 1.0.1

needed currently:

item flags for switching to different screens, aka making them into buttons

maybe test saving and loading again a few times, mainly because loading items didn't load all the items in the save file

utility for switching items between screens => get item uuid, save item to different screen and delete it from current

update save and load to save the screen that items were saved on
